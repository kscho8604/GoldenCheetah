Supported operating systems: Microsoft 7, 8, 8.1 and 10.

When using this package with CP210x devices, you must change the
default factory Product ID (PID) from 0xEA60 to 0xEA61. Install the
device as instructed in your CP210x Development Kit along with the
Virtual Serial Port Drivers. Once the device is installed, use the
CP210xSetIDs.exe program to change the PID to 0xEA61. Then you may
load the USBXpress device driver included in this package.


Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------

	1) A call to SI_GetProductString with 'Options' set to
	SI_RETURN_DESCRIPTION will return only the driver description string,
	and not the one in the device.
	
	2) When using SI_SetBaudRate with CP2101, only the valid baud rates
	listed in the CP2101 data sheet should be used. Attempting to use
	other baud rates will return SI_DEVICE_IO_FAILED. 
	   
	3) When using overlapped I/O with USBXPress 4, CancelIo is not longer
	supported. Instead use the new SI_CancelIo() function.

version 3.2
	Corrections
	-----------
	- Fixed a multi-threading bug where an Access Violation occurs when
	opening and closing a device over multiple threads. There was code in
	the DLL to clean up and close handles that weren't explicitly close
	by the user. This code has been taken out and it is up to the user to
	ensure their handle gets closed on exit.
	

version 3.1.1a
	New Features/Enhancements
	-------------------------
	- Added a 64 bit version of the SiUSBXp.DLL library.

	Corrections
	-----------
	- Corrected to not allow the DLL to clean up an open handle on a
	thread detach.


version 3.1.1
	New Features/Enhancements
	-------------------------	
	- Updated Visual C++ 6.0 Test Panel example source to correctly
	handle open/close and timeouts.
	- Added Visual C# .NET 2005 Test Panel example source code.
	

version 3.1
	New Features/Enhancements
	-------------------------	
	- Updated Driver for Vista and re-certified through Winqual for
	2K/XP/S2K3/Vista(x86/x64)
	- Updated the USBXpress Driver Installer to version 2.0 which
	includes Vista.
	- Added two functions to the DLL, SI_GetDriverVersion and
	SI_GetDLLVersion.


version 3.0.5
	Corrections
	-----------
	- Corrected SI_CheckRXQueue so that the correct number of bytes is
	returned, and is a meaningful value. The flags are also confirmed for
	this function.
	- Addressed blue screen issue for surprise removal of USBXpress
	device that is connected and opened.
	- Updated the USBXpress Installer to version 1.5. This eliminates
	rare Windows 2K errors which claim that the driver cannot be
	uninstalled.
	

version 3.0.4
	New Features/Enhancements
	-------------------------
	- Modified the driver to pend multiple I/O requests.
	- SI_Read now allows reads to complete with less than the data
	requested, as long as there are more than 0 bytes. Check the buffer
	length returned from the SI_Read function to determine the exact
	number of bytes that are returned.

	Corrections
	-----------
	- Updated the USBXpress Installer to version 1.4. This eliminates
	errors when trying to install/uninstall read-only files.


version 3.0.3
	Corrections
	-----------
	- Modfied SI_Read and SI_Write to cancel IO operations that timeout
	or fail.
	- Corrected a bug in the driver which returns an incorrect amount of
	bytes for SI_Read.
	- Changed the return value when SI_Read is called for a second time
	and the first SI_Read is still pending, it will show up as a system
	error.


version 3.0.1
	Corrections
	-----------
	- Corrected the DLL Thread/Process Detach functionality to call the
	updated version of SI_Close.
	- Changed the default DLL Timeout values to be infinite instead of 0.
	This prevents timeouts occurring on current code, and makes calls the
	do not set any timeouts to be synchronous but non-blocking.


version 3.0
	New Features/Enhancements
	-------------------------
	- This verison of the driver is certifiable, and has been certified
	for XP and Server 2003.
	- SI_Read is no longer a blocking call. The interface now has an
	added overlapped object parameter that can be passed to the function.
	Otherwise, old code will work because the parameter defaults to NULL.
	If it is NULL, then the SI_Read function will not block, and performs
	the wait inside of the SiUSBXp.DLL.
	- A new installation utility has been introduced which will clear old
	installations to always successfully upgrade the Driver to the latest
	version. This new utility can be customized without breaking the
	driver's certification.
	
	Corrections
	-----------
	- SI_GetProductString was fixed so that the requested string is
	correctly returned.
	- SI_Open change to return INVALID_PARAMATER instead of the incorrect
	INVALID_HANLDE_VALUE whenever an invalid HANDLE pointer is provided.

	
version 2.42
	Corrections
	-----------
	'USBXpress Host API
		Fixed the constant SI_WRITE_FAILED return when USING
		SI_Write();

	Corrections
	-----------
	'USBXPress Host API:

	to v2.4.
	'F3xx firmware libraries:
		USBX_F320_1.LIB firmware library is compatible with 'F320/1
		and 'F34x devices.
		Added FileTransfer and TestPanel examples for 'F34x devices
		- please note that these examples are the same as those for
		'F32x device because those devices  are code-compatible.	
		Added new firmware library for C8051F326/7 devices
		(USBX_F326_7.LIB).
		Added FileTransfer example for C8051F326/7 devices.
		If you are porting an existing application from 'F320/1 to
		'F326/7, please note that these two families are not exactly
		code-compatible. See the device datasheets for more details.
		Added function USB_Get_Library_Version to library that returns
		a 2-byte BCD value (0x0241=2.41); Previously, the only way to
		determine the version was by the file date.

	Corrections
	-----------
	'F320/1 firmware library:
		Fixed issue in v2.3 library that ignored a IN endpoint halt
		command.

	INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE.
	Updated invalid handle and invalid parameter checks in the API.
	'F320/1 firmware library:
		Fixed USB_Disable() hang issue.
		Eliminated unnecessary delay in Block_Write() when sending a
		zero-length packet.
		Corrected USB clock startup code to check if clock multiplier
		is already enabled.

		space; NULL cannot be used any more to choose defaults.
